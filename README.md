# 🛡️ R5S — Rust 5.0 with Sustainable Safety & Security  
### *A sustainable and secure Rust ecosystem built on R3C.*

> “If R3C gave Rust independence, and R4W gave it reach, R5S gives it trust.”

---

## 🧭 Overview
**R5S (Rust 5.0)** is an experimental LLVM-free framework that extends the [R3C](https://github.com/0200134/r3c) compiler and [R4W](https://github.com/0200134/R4W) runtime to focus on  
**sustainable safety, security, and long-term reliability.**

> **Goal:** A self-auditing, self-healing Rust ecosystem without LLVM or external toolchain dependencies.

## 🧱 Architecture



C++ → Rust (via R3C) → ASM → R4W (Web Runtime) → R5S (Security Layer)



| Layer | Role | Focus |
|--------|------|-------|
| R3C | LLVM-free Compiler | Self-hosting core language |
| R4W | Web Execution Layer | Platform independence |
| **R5S** | Security + Sustainability Layer | Integrity · Safety · Long-term LTS |

---

## 🧩 Core Objectives
- **Sustainable Safety:** Long-term memory and type safety beyond language semantics.  
- **Security at Build Time:** Static analysis and signature embedding in the R3C pipeline.  
- **Self-Integrity:** Each binary verifies its own source fingerprint.  
- **Eco-Longevity:** Design for decades of support and reproducibility (LTSS).  

---

## 🔐 Security Vision
R5S introduces a new compiler phase called `TrustCore`:  
> Detect vulnerabilities before execution and embed cryptographic integrity into every build.  

Features under research:
- Compile-time encryption of metadata  
- Runtime integrity scanner  
- Immutable dependency graph based on `cpppm + r3c`  
- Hardware-assisted sandbox hooks  

---

## 🔧 Build Prototype
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0200134/R5S.git
cd R5S
cargo build --release



Future: r5s build --secure --ltss



🪶 Philosophy




“Independence was the beginning. Sustainability is the legacy.”
